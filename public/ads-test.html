	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Dropbox synchronizes files across your/your team's computers. It's much better
	than uploading or email, because it's automatic, integrated into Windows, and
	fits into the way you already work. There's also a web interface, and the files
	are securely backed up to Amazon S3. Dropbox is kind of like taking the best
	elements of subversion, trac and rsync and making them "just work" for the
	average individual or team. Hackers have access to these tools, but normal
	people don't.<br>
	<br>
	There are lots of interesting possible features. One is syncing Google
	Docs/Spreadsheets (or other office web apps) to local .doc and .xls files for
	offline access, which would be strategically important as few web apps deal with
	the offline problem.<br>

	name; age; year, school, degree, and subject for each degree; email address;
	personal url (if any); and present employer and title (if any). Put unfinished
	degrees in parens. List the main contact first. Separate founders with blank
	lines. Put an asterisk before the name of anyone not able to move to Boston for
	the summer. &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

	--; Bit9, Inc (went full time to part time 1/07) - project lead/software
	engineer<br>
	<br>
	Although I'm working with other people on Dropbox, strictly speaking I'm the
	only founder right now. My friend (redacted), a great hacker, Stanford grad
	and creator of (redacted) is putting together a Mac
	port, but can't join as a founder right now as a former cofounder of his started
	an extremely similar company. My friend and roommate (redacted)
	from MIT is helping out too, but he works with me at Bit9, and a non-solicit
	clause in my employment contract prevents me from recruiting him (and the VP Eng
	explicitly told me not to recruit him.)<br>
	<br>
	In any case, I have several leads, have been networking aggressively, and fully
	intend to get someone else on board -- either another good hacker or a more
	sales-oriented guy (e.g. the role Matt fills at Xobni). I'm aware that the odds
	aren't good for single founders, and would rather work with other people anyway.<br>

	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Drew - Programming since age 5; startups since age 14; 1600 on SAT; started
	profitable online SAT prep company in college (accoladeprep.com). For fun last
	summer reverse engineered the software on a number of poker sites and wrote a
	real-money playing poker bot (it was about break-even; see screenshot url later
	in the app.)<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># What's new about what you're doing?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Most small teams have a few basic needs: (1) team members need their important
	stuff in front of them wherever they are, (2) everyone needs to be working on
	the latest version of a given document (and ideally can track what's changed),
	(3) and team data needs to be protected from disaster. There are sync tools
	(e.g. beinsync, Foldershare), there are backup tools (Carbonite, Mozy), and
	there are web uploading/publishing tools (box.net, etc.), but there's no good
	integrated solution.<br>
	<br>
	Dropbox solves all these needs, and doesn't need configuration or babysitting.
	Put another way, it takes concepts that are proven winners from the dev
	community (version control, changelogs/trac, rsync, etc.) and puts them in a
	package that my little sister can figure out (she uses Dropbox to keep track of
	her high school term papers, and doesn't need to burn CDs or carry USB sticks
	anymore.)<br>
	<br>
	At a higher level, online storage and local disks are big and cheap. But the
	internet links in between have been and will continue to be slow in comparison.
	In "the future", you won't have to move your data around manually. The concept
	that I'm most excited about is that the core technology in Dropbox -- continuous
	efficient sync with compression and binary diffs -- is what will get us there.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># What do you understand about your business that
	other companies in it just don't get?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Competing products work at the wrong layer of abstraction and/or force the user
	to constantly think and do things. The "online disk drive" abstraction sucks,
	because you can't work offline and the OS support is extremely brittle. Anything
	that depends on manual emailing/uploading (i.e. anything web-based) is a
	non-starter, because it's basically doing version control in your head. But
	virtually all competing services involve one or the other.<br>
	<br>
	With Dropbox, you hit "Save", as you normally would, and everything just works,
	even with large files (thanks to binary diffs).<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># What are people forced to do now because what
	you plan to make doesn't exist yet? &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Email themselves attachments. Upload stuff to online storage sites or use online
	drives like Xdrive, which don't work on planes. Carry around USB drives, which
	can be lost, stolen, or break/get bad sectors. Waste time revising the wrong
	versions of given documents, resulting in Frankendocuments that contain some
	changes but lose others. My friend Reuben is switching his financial consulting
	company from a PHP-based CMS to a beta of Dropbox because all they used it for
	was file sharing. Techies often hack together brittle solutions involving web
	hosting, rsync, and cron jobs, or entertaining abominations such as those listed
	in this slashdot article ("Small Office Windows Backup Software" -
	http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/04/0336246).<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># How will you make money?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	The current plan is a freemium approach, where we give away free 1GB accounts
	and charge for additional storage (maybe ~$5/mo or less for 10GB for individuals
	and team plans that start at maybe $20/mo.). It's hard to get consumers to pay
	for things, but fortunately small/medium businesses already pay for solutions
	that are subsets of what Dropbox does and are harder to use. There will be
	tiered pricing for business accounts (upper tiers will retain more older
	versions of documents, have branded extranets for secure file sharing with
	clients/partners, etc., and an 'enterprise' plan that features, well, a really
	high price.)<br>
	<br>
	I've already been approached by potential partners/customers asking for an API
	to programmatically create Dropboxes (e.g. to handle file sharing for
	Assembla.com, a web site for managing global dev teams). There's a natural
	synergy between Basecamp-like project mgmt/groupware web apps (for the to-do
	lists, calendaring, etc.) and Dropbox for file sharing. I've also had requests
	for an enterprise version that would sit on a company's network (as opposed to
	my S3 store) for which I could probably charge a lot.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Who are your competitors, and who might become
	competitors? Who do you fear most? &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Carbonite and Mozy do a good job with hassle-free backup, and a move into sync
	would make sense. Sharpcast (venture funded) announced a similar app called
	Hummingbird, but according to (redacted)
	they're taking an extraordinarily difficult approach involving NT kernel
	drivers. Google's coming out with GDrive at some point. Microsoft's Groove does
	sync and is part of Office 2007, but is very heavyweight and doesn't include any
	of the web stuff or backup. There are apps like Omnidrive and Titanize but the
	implementations are buggy or have bad UIs.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># For founders who are hackers: what cool things
	have you built? (Include urls if possible.)
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Accolade Online SAT prep (launched in 2004) (http://www.accoladeprep.com/); a
	poker bot (here's an old screenshot: https://www.accoladeprep.com/sshot2.gif;
	it's using play money there but worked with real money too.)<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
	# How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	There's a joke in here somewhere.<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
	# What tools will you use to build your product?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Python (top to bottom.) sqlite (client), mysql (server). Turbogears (at least
	until it won't scale.) Amazon EC2 and S3 for serving file data.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># If you've already started working on it, how
	long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you
	written? &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	3 months part time. About ~5KLOC client and ~2KLOC server of python, C++,
	Cheetah templates, installer scripts, etc.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># If you have an online demo, what's the url?<br>
	</span>Here's a screencast that I'll also put up on news.yc:<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	If you do have a Windows box or two, here's the latest build:<br>
	<br>
	http://www.getdropbox.com/u/2/DropboxInstaller.exe<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># How long will it take before you have a
	prototype? A beta? A version you can charge for?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Prototype - done in Feb. Version I can charge for:
	8 weeks maybe? <i>(ed: hahaha)</I><br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Which companies would be most likely to buy
	you? &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Google/MS/Yahoo are all acutely interested in this general space. Google
	announced GDrive/"Platypus" a long time ago but the release date is uncertain (a
	friend at Google says the first implementation was this ghetto VBScript/Java
	thing for internal use only). MS announced Live Drive and bought Foldershare in
	'05 which does a subset of what Dropbox does. Iron Mountain, Carbonite or Mozy
	or anyone else dealing with backup for SMBs could also be interested, as none of
	them have touched the sync problem to date.<br>
	<br>
	In some ways, Dropbox is for arbitrary files what Basecamp is for lightweight
	project management, and the two would plug together really well (although
	37signals doesn't seem like the buying-companies type).<br>
	<br>
	At the end of the day, though, it's an extremely capital-efficient business. We
	know people are willing to pay for this and just want to put together something
	that rocks and get it in front of as many people as possible.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># If one wanted to buy you three months in
	(August 2007), what's the lowest offer you'd take?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	I'd rather see the idea through, but I'd probably have a hard time turning down
	$1m after taxes for 6 months of work.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Why would your project be hard for someone else
	to duplicate? &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	This idea requires executing well in several somewhat orthogonal directions, and
	missteps in any torpedo the entire product.<br>
	<br>
	For example, there's an academic/theoretical component: designing the protocol
	and app to behave consistently/recoverably when any power or ethernet cord in
	the chain could pop out at any time. There's a gross Win32 integration piece
	(ditto for a Mac port). There's a mostly Linux/Unix-oriented operations/sysadmin
	and scalability piece. Then there's the web design and UX piece to make things
	simple and sexy. Most of these hats are pretty different, and if executing in
	all these directions was easy, a good product/service would already exist.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Do you have any ideas you consider patentable?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	(redacted)<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># What might go wrong? (This is a test of
	imagination, not confidence.) &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Google might finally unleash GDrive and steal a lot of Dropbox's thunder
	(especially if this takes place before launch.) In general, the online storage
	space is extremely noisy, so being marginally better isn't good enough; there
	has to be a leap in value worthy of writing/blogging/telling friends about. I'll
	need to bring on cofounder(s) and build a team, which takes time. Other
	competitors are much better funded; we might need to raise working capital to
	accelerate growth. There will be the usual growing pains scaling and finding
	bottlenecks (although I've provisioned load balanced, high availability web apps
	before.) Acquiring small business customers might be more expensive/take longer
	than hoped. Prioritizing features and choosing the right market segments to
	tackle will be hard. Getting love from early adopters will be important, but
	getting distracted by/releasing late due to frivolous feature requests could be
	fatal.<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
	# If you're already incorporated, when were you? Who are the shareholders and
	what percent does each own? If you've had funding, how much, at what
	valuation(s)? &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Not incorporated<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># If you're not incorporated yet, please list the
	percent of the company you plan to give each founder, and anyone else you plan
	to give stock to. (This question is as much for you as us.)

	Drew<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># If you'll have any major expenses beyond the
	living costs of your founders, bandwidth, and servers, what will they be?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	None; maybe AdWords.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># If by August your startup seems to have a
	significant (say 20%) chance of making you rich, which of the founders would
	commit to working on it full-time for the next several years?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Drew<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Do any founders have other commitments between
	June and August 2007 inclusive? &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	No; I've given notice at Bit9 to work on this full time regardless of YC
	funding.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Do any founders have commitments in the future
	(e.g. have been accepted to grad school), and if so what?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	No. Probably moving to SF in September<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes
	or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? Will any be
	working as employees or consultants for anyone else?
	&nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	Drew: Some work was done at the Bit9 office; I consulted an attorney and have a
	signed letter indicating Bit9 has no stake/ownership of any kind in Dropbox<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Was any of your code written by someone who is
	not one of your founders? If so, how can you safely use it? (Open source is ok
	of course.) &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	No<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># If you had any other ideas you considered
	applying with, feel free to list them. One may be something we've been waiting
	for. &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	One click screen sharing (already done pretty well by Glance); a wiki with
	version-controlled drawing canvases that let you draw diagrams or mock up UIs
	(Thinkature is kind of related, but this is more text with canvases interspersed
	than a shared whiteboard) to help teams get on the same page and spec things out
	better (we use Visio and Powerpoint at Bit9, which sucks)<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"># Please tell us something surprising or amusing
	that one of you has discovered. (The answer need not be related to your
	project.) &nbsp;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
	The ridiculous things people name their documents to do versioning, like
	"proposal v2 good revised NEW 11-15-06.doc", continue to crack me up.
